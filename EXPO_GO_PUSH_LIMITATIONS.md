# üì± Push Notifications: Expo Go vs Development Build

## Current Issue
You're seeing this error because **push notifications have limited support in Expo Go** since SDK 53:

```
ERROR: No "projectId" found. Push notifications functionality provided by expo-notifications was removed from Expo Go with the release of SDK 53.
```

## ‚úÖ Solutions

### Option 1: Use Development Build (Recommended)
For full push notification support, create a development build:

```bash
# Install EAS CLI if you haven't
npm install -g @expo/eas-cli

# Build for development
eas build --profile development --platform ios
# or for Android
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

### Option 2: Test with Expo Go (Limited)
Your app will still work with **local notifications** in Expo Go:
- ‚úÖ Transaction notifications show up
- ‚úÖ Notification center works  
- ‚úÖ Local push notifications work
- ‚ùå Remote push notifications don't work

## üîß What We've Fixed
I've updated your app to handle push notification failures gracefully:

1. **Better Error Handling**: Clear error messages explaining Expo Go limitations
2. **Graceful Fallbacks**: App continues working even if push notifications fail
3. **Local Notifications**: Still work for transaction notifications
4. **Notification Center**: All notifications are still saved locally

## üìã Current Notification Flow

### ‚úÖ What Works in Expo Go:
- Transaction notifications appear locally
- Notification center stores all notifications  
- Visual indicators and badges work
- Security PIN change flow works

### ‚ùå What Doesn't Work in Expo Go:
- Push notifications when app is closed/minimized
- Remote push notifications from your backend

## üéØ For Production
When you're ready to deploy:

1. **Create a development build** for full testing
2. **Set up push notification backend** with your Expo push tokens
3. **Test on real devices** with the development build

## üí° Testing Your Security PIN Flow
Your security PIN change flow is completely ready to test in Expo Go:

1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Security**
2. Tap any PIN change option (Login/Transaction/Duress)
3. Complete the email verification flow
4. Test the entire PIN change process

The security features don't depend on push notifications and work perfectly in Expo Go!

## üîß Technical Details
- **Local notifications**: Still trigger after 1-2 seconds
- **Notification storage**: All notifications saved in context
- **Error handling**: App logs helpful messages but continues working
- **ProjectId**: Automatically handled when available, graceful fallback when not

Your app is robust and handles notification failures gracefully! üéâ
