);
```

### Add Custom Sound

1. Add `.wav` file to `assets/`
2. Update `app.json`:
```json
"notification": {
  "sound": "./assets/notification.wav"
}
```

### Customize Navigation

In `navigationService.ts`:
```typescript
case 'transaction':
  // Change destination
  navigate('TransactionDetails', { id: data.transactionId });
  break;
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: No Notifications After Transaction

**Check:**
1. ✅ Push token was generated (check console)
2. ✅ Permissions are granted
3. ✅ Transaction completed successfully

# Restart the app
npx expo start --clear
```

### Problem: Notifications Don't Navigate

**Check:**

Navigate to: App
```

2. ✅ Notifications marked as unread

**Solution:**
Open notification center and mark all as read, then complete new transaction.

### Problem: No Sound

**Check:**
1. ✅ iPhone not in silent mode
